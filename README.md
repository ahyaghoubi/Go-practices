# Go Language Practices

Welcome to the **Go Language Practices** repository! This repository serves as a collection of my hands-on projects and exercises as I explore and learn the Go programming language. It includes examples, algorithms, problem-solving exercises, and practical implementations of various concepts in Go.

## Projects and Exercises

### 1. Investment Calculator
The first project in this repository is an **Investment Calculator** that calculates the future value of an investment and its inflation-adjusted value. 

#### Features:
- Calculate future value based on investment amount, expected return rate, and number of years.
- Adjust the future value based on a predefined inflation rate.

#### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahyaghoubi/go-practices.git
   cd go-practices
   ```
2. Navigate to the `investment-calculator` directory:
   ```bash
   cd investment-calculator
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
4. Input the investment amount, the number of years, and the expected return rate when prompted. The program will output:
   - The future value of the investment.
   - The inflation-adjusted value of the investment.

#### Example Input/Output:
```
Enter the investment amount: 10000
Enter the number of years: 10
Enter the expected return rate: 5
The future value of the investment is $16288.95
The inflation-adjusted value of the investment is $12697.56
```
